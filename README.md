WebSockets : Real-Time Chat Tutorial
====================================

Together with [Attila](https://github.com/Tr1ckX), I worked through the [socket.io "write a chat application" tutorial](http://socket.io/get-started).  This project show-cases real-time functionality offered through web-sockets and Node.js.  Multiple users can visit the site, post, and then see other subsequent posts in real-time.  We extended the project a touch so that users that define a name on log-in will see their name affixed to all their postings.  We followed the basic design outlined by the tutorial.  The project [can be found here](https://benwebsockets.herokuapp.com/).
